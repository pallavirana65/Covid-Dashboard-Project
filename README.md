# Covid-Dashboard-Project

This project is from Alex the Analyst's YouTube Channel. 
First I collected COVID data from the Our World In Data website. 
Then I wrote queries in SQL, guided by Alex the Analyst's tutorials, to analyze the COVID data.
We selected 4 specific queries to represent in a dashboard created with Tableau Public.

Dashboard can be found on my Tableau Public Profile: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pallavi.rana8453
